<h1>English 12-Keys Keyboard</h1>

<p style="font-size:larger">
The style of this keyboard reminiscent to the old 12-keys numpad keyboard on "dumb phones" (eg. old phones like Nokia). But because the function has evolved from primarily to dial number to become a keyboard, thus the design has been updated, but still based on the standard E.161 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.161) ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector's Recommendation that defines the arrangement of digits, letters, and symbols on telephone keypads.

For those of you who are not old enough to remember this keyboard layout, lucky you! Here's some primer:
<ol>
<li>Tap button multiple time to get the letter you wanted. For example, tap the "abc" button twice to get the letter "b", and thrice to get "c".</li>
<li>The same with the symbols and punctuations (,?!) (':") and (/()). These may be called the button rotation feature.</li>
<li>Unlike the original numpad keyboard, which has a button delay (for example, press "abc" once to get an "a", then wait a second, press "abc" again, and you'll get "aa") there is no button delay on Keyman (if you did the previous routine, you'll end up with "b" no matter how long the wait, or even if you clicked somewhere else first). So I had to use "zero-width joiner" (on the empty button up left / number 1 location). Basically it's an invisible space, and it tells the keyboard to start the button rotation sequence from the beginning.</li>
<li>Longpress: if you want to type a number, you can either longpress the corresponding button -- for example "abc" is "2" -- or press the "123" button to get the numeric keypad.</li>
<li>Some other buttons also have the longpress keys, such as the "period" ("-", "@", and others), and the "spacebar" (0, qwerty keyboard, and hide keyboard button).</li>
<li>Multi-layers: you can still access the 'qwerty' layout, in case you need it, through longpressing the space key.</li>
<li>All Keyman Keyboards are multi-platform: PC, Android, Mac, iOS, web, etc. If you have access to the .kmn file, you can use it anywhere. But this layout is mainly for the touch experience. The physical (PC/Mac) layout are the same.</li>
